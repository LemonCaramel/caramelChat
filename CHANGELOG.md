This release took quite a long time. After starting a new job, I simply didn’t have enough time to balance work, studies, and updating the mod. (And that’s likely to remain the case going forward.) There are still a few important bugs that need to be fixed, but at the moment, I don’t have the time to look into them. Since it seems like some people have been waiting for this release, I’ve decided to push it out quickly. Sorry again for the delay!

- Support Minecraft 1.21.5+
- (fix) X11 controller crash/not working by @MATRIX-feather
- (lang) Add Traditional Chinese (zh_tw.json) by @yichifauzi
